------------------------------------our 2-34 (33) angular modes are mode of 33 basic directions, so you have to use more than 33 kernals for angular modes------------------------------------0: planar; 1: DC;------------------------------------35:DMM136:DMM4------------------------------------------------------------------------37 Features in total at least================================================================================================1. [DONE, DOES NOT WORK]after md_gpu_7,  try to run 6.4 which has 5 conv layers, i just cannot believe that it won't work, ---> ACTUALLY IT DOES NOT WORK......2.[TWO MUCH, DOES WORK IN THIS CASE 16 * 16 ]in the md_gpu_7_more_training_data version,try conv_k = 150try conv_l = 450try conv_m = 1500CONV_K = 60  # first conv layer output depth  ----------CONV_L = 120  # second conv layer output depthCONV_M = 240  #3.[DONE, DOES NOT WORK] try bigger KERNAL size, 16*16******************************************************************
